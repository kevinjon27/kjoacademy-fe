# About the Student Facing Site

- The admin routes and pages are placed within `app/admin` directory.
- It has its own `layout.tsx` component
- Use the shared components from the `src/components` directory whenever possible
- If an Student page needs a dedicated component and it is specific for Student site only, create the components in `src/components`
- Leave the `src/components/ui` directory for generated shadcn components
