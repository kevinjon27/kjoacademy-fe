# Admin API Contracts

- This is the rule for you to properly create the type definitions for the API requests and responses for the Admin side
- Refer to the `.mdc` rules within the `./cursor/rules/api/contracts/admin/` for the complete list of the contracts for each feature domain
- You need to create the type definitions within the `src/types/dto`.
- Take attention at the BASE_URLs defined for each feature domain. This should be your guide to create the client API definition like `src/api/admin/categories.api.ts`
