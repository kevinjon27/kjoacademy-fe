- The admin routes and pages are placed within `@/app/(main)` directory.
- The root `layout.tsx` component should be kept lean at it is.
- The main layout for the student features (except auth) is the `@/app/(protected)/layout.tsx`. This layout wraps the app with the necessary Providers
- Use the shared components from the `@/components/shared` directory whenever possible
- If an Student page needs a dedicated component and it is specific for Student site only, create the components in `@/components/student`
- Leave the `@/components/ui` directory for generated shadcn components
