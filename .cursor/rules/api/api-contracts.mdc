# API Contracts

## Admin API Contracts

- This is the rule for you to properly create the type definitions for the API requests and responses on the Admin side.
- Refer to the `.mdc` rules within the `.cursor/rules/api/contracts/admin/` for the complete list of the contracts for each feature domain

## Student API Contracts

- This is the rule for you to properly create the type definitions for the API requests and responses on the Student side.
- Refer to the `.mdc` rules within the `.cursor/rules/api/contracts/student` for the complete list of the contracts for each feature domain

## Important on Paginated Queries

- Use laravel `paginate` to process data with pagination
- You need to make sure that we do not bring all the laravel paginated data attributes. We want to only bring the attributes define in the shape below:

```txt:paginatedData
{
  data: T[];
  current_page: number;
  per_page: number;
  last_page: number;
  from: number;
  to: number;
  total: number;
}
```
