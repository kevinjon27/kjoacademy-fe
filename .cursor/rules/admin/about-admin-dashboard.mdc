# The Admin Dashboard of KJO Academy LMS

- The admin dashboard will be used to manage the course categories, courses, modules, and lessons across the app
- The admin routes and pages are placed within `app/admin` directory.
- It has its own `layout.tsx` component
- Use the shared components from the `src/components` directory whenever possible
- If an Admin page needs a dedicated component and it is specific for Admin site only, create the components in `src/components/admin`
- Leave the `src/components/ui` directory for generated shadcn components
- The admin page does not need translations. Use English for the wordings.
