- The main layout for the dashboard features (except auth) is the `src/app/admin/(protected)/layout.tsx`. This layout contains the sidebar, header, and the content
- Use the shared components from the `src/components` directory whenever possible
- If an Admin page needs a dedicated component and it is specific for Admin site only, create the components in `src/components/admin`
- Leave the `src/components/ui` directory for generated shadcn components
- The admin page does not need translations. Use English for the wordings.
