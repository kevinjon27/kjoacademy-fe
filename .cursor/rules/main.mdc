# Overview

Important! You need to know that this project uses:

- NextJS 15.4.6
- typescript ^5
- pnpm 10.14.0
- tailwindcss ^4 for the CSS utility classes
- shadcn to manage our ui components

Here are the project directories and their responsibilities:

- `app`: this is where we define route segment, route layout, and the route page component itself
- `components`:
  - the root of this directory could be used to contain custom ui made by us
  - the `ui` is used to contain the components that we generate with `shadcn`
- `lib`: contains our helper functions
- `config`: contains our configuration files and constants

IMPORTANT:

- Always use the `pnpm` to handle dependencies.
